# Requirements Document: BharatChef AI Coach

## Introduction

BharatChef AI is an AI-powered cooking skill evaluation and coaching platform that objectively assesses culinary skills using video analysis. The system compares trainee cooking videos with expert benchmark videos and provides structured feedback, performance scores, and personalized coaching to help culinary students, trainee chefs, and aspiring cooks improve their skills systematically.

The MVP focuses on core video capture, action recognition, benchmark comparison, scoring, and AI-generated feedback for 3-5 initial dishes, deployable on low-cost Android smartphones with cloud processing.
